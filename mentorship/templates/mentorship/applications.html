        <h1 class="display-4">Welcome to the ACMM Application Portal!</h1>
        <p class="lead">Dear mentors and mentees, welcome to our mentoring scheme this coming year. This is our 6th year
            of helping
            African Caribbean prospective medical and dental students achieve their dreams with mentoring on a 1 to 1
            basis during the course of UCAS applications.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            ACMM started after identifying the need to have more black students represented in medical school and
            therefore within the profession. On our journey into and during medical school, we found a lack of support
            for black students, combined with a lack of representation within the field. This was backed up by various
            statistics that demonstrate our underrepresentation in Medicine and Dentistry. We therefore co- founded ACMM
            to help further the chances of prospective Afro-Caribbean students into medical school, to realise the
            potential of these students and to encourage future applicants to think about a career in medicine.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            What does the ACMM mentoring scheme involve?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            As a mentor you will be matched with one mentee, who you will support for a year â€“ from June until June of the
            next year.
            You will support your mentee in their medical school application by providing help and advice on entrance
            exams, personal statements and hopefully interview preparation. We will try and match you with a mentee who
            has similar personal characteristics to you in order to make the mentoring relationship as beneficial as
            possible. You will commit to monthly contact as a bare minimum, with more contact and support given in the
            summer prior to application.
            <br/>
